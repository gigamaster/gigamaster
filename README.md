## Hi, I'm Nuno Luciano aka gigamaster

Life, to me, is refreshingly simple:  
We stay busy doing stuff.  
Some things crash and burn.  
Some actually work.  
And almost everything we touch leaves a fingerprint, on people, on places, on the planet.

For the past 20+ years I've been lucky enough to work on research & development projects that help people express their creativity; through art, design, music, learning experiences, collaboration tools, open-source experiments… basically anything that reminds us why being alive is worth the trouble.

My contributions tend to be gloriously agenda-free and delightfully informal. No 5-year roadmap. No investor pitch deck.  
Just ideas that feel meaningful at 2 a.m. and code that sometimes survives until morning.  
This approach has a name, backed by centuries of scientific and inventive history: **serendipity**.

So if you're browsing these repos and think “this guy clearly wandered off the path”…  
you're not wrong. You're just witnessing the path being redrawn in real time.

Welcome to the detour.  
Feel free to fork, remix, break things, or just wave hello.  
I'm usually around.

## ////— The Evolution of Technology — Past, Present, and Future 

The true magic of technological evolution lies in the creative spark, that unique blend of imagination and freedom to choose the right programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools for each project.
Programming languages are incredibly adaptable: the same instructions can be combined in countless unexpected ways to solve everyday problems or build entirely new possibilities.
The key is finding the language and ecosystem that best match your needs, your vision, and the real-world context of your work.
Choose deliberately. Create freely.

Philosophical

> Learn everything you can.  
  Try everything that comes along.  
  Look at everything there is to see.  
  Search, experiment, make mistakes, fail, stand up.  
  Turn religious, turn conservative, turn radical.  
  And then forget all about it and find your way to create."
