I'm an adult educator and multimedia producer who sees life very simply: we try to stay busy doing things, some fail, others succeed, and almost everything we do has an impact on our environment and on the people.  

Thus, I have been involved for two decades in research & development projects that facilitate the expression of one's creativity, through art, design, music, learning, cooperation, etc... all things that give meaning to life.  

My contributions are generally very informal and without a pre-agreed agenda. This statement is the result of empirical evidence, meaning in simple terms that "Serendipity" is an unintentional chance discovery, a common phenomenon throughout the history of product invention and scientific discovery: "Look for something, find something else, and realize that what you found is more suitable to your needs than what you thought you were looking for.

## ////‚Äî Evolution of Technology ‚Äî Past, Present, and Future 

**The magic of the creative spark** is a spicy combination of imagination and free choice of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, templates, etc. The adaptability to everyday life in general and the wide choice of programming languages refer to the many unexpected ways in which the language's instructions can be used. So, find the programming language and tools that meet your needs and your projects.  

Philosophical

> Learn everything you can.  
  Try everything that comes along.  
  Look at everything there is to see.  
  Search, experiment, make mistakes, fail, stand up.  
  Turn religious, turn conservative, turn radical.  
  And then forget all about it and find your way to create."
